# MatchingFundraiser
Analyzes a .csv file of students and their answers to a Google form. Then, returns the top matches for each student, meaning the top 5 girls and top 5 guys that matched with them. 

Notes:
- You have to have an application that you can run this script from if you arn't using Terminal. For beginners, I would suggest Thonny, but others would work too.
- MAKE SURE that the CSV file you are using is in the same directory that the program is operating from.
- Separate forms should be used for middle and high school, as there is no way for the script to differentiate between the two.
- ChatGPT can probably understand the program, so if you are having trouble with it, feel free to ask chatGPT. It's a simple program.

This program was made by H. G. and intended for fundraisers ran by Eminence Independent School District, though it is available for all to use.
